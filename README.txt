Setup Instructions
Potentiometer connected to GrovePi port 0
Ultrasound sensor connected to GrovePi port 4
1. ssh into RPi
2. cd ~/Documents/ultrasonic-theremin/RPi
3. Run python2 sensors.py
4. In another terminal cd ~/Documents/ultrasonic-theremin
5. Run python3 server.py
6. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/

* Context including a description of the project and the project directions were used for this chat*

- most docstrings and larger comment headers for commenting/documentation were AI generated
Prompt: *pasted full code files* Can you return each code file with docstrings for all functions and comment 
headers for sections; do not add or change in-line comments

- Flask-socketio and threading sections were AI generated
Prompt: *pasted laptop mqtt client* The MQTT client needs to connect to a server that can send real-time data to
a frontend. Can you do this using websockets and flask. I already have a normal http flask route pointing to 
index.html which will be the singular dashboard page. 

- Sounddevice implementation is AI generated (though initial signal generation  with numpy is not)
Prompt: *pasted server.py file* *pasted signal generation script* Now implement the audio generation part with 
sounddevice using the attached signal generation logic including the hard-coded harmonics/overtones. Feel free
to proofreed the initial code.

- html, css, and js are fully generated by AI according to my style peferences
Prompt: You can now generate the full frontend. For design use blue, white, and grey, with the light blue shade
for the background. Call it Ultrasonic Theremin Dashboard with subtitle IoT Musical Instrument Visualizer.
Include boxes for status (silent/playing), Frequency and musical note, volume percentage, and distance in cm.
Include the chart.js waveform plot for the current generated waveform. Include freq over time plot from 0 1200 Hz
for the past 20 seconds in real time. Include bubble to show whether connected or disconnected.

- test server generated by AI from the real server as a reference; AI was used for 
debugging the socket connection issues between the test server and the js event listeners
Prompt: Can you create a test server to test the frontend. It should send generated ultrasound and volume data to
the frontend in the same way the real server would at 20 Hz.
